<p>This is a functionality in development and not available in the current version of Thelia</p>
</div>

When you create a module for Thelia, you might want it to interact with the site in 2 ways :

- The heart of Thelia to generate new behaviors, such as sending an email to the administrator when a product is no longer available. On Thelia, this functionality is managed by the Events Listener/Dispatcher.
- Changing the display of some area of pages. You can control this with **Hooks**

The **Hooks** are actually entry points in the templates in which the modules will insert their own code, add new features and change the appearance of the site.

Before Hooks, the only way to change the display of the site was to change the template of the site to include new pieces of code to interact with the module.
This solution was not ideal as it required some integration work and can be quite complex for beginners and could cause problems if the modified template was the default Thelia template and an update of this template is available.

With Hooks, integration becomes easier to see fully automatic. The modules using hooks provide a default implementation based on the default Thelia template. If you have created a template based on the default template then you should have nothing else to do than to activate the module.

The great strength of Thelia is the possibility to customize the display of the site. It is possible that some modules do not integrate in an optimal way with their default implementation.
Fortunately, a system of overriding is possible in the template, without having to touch module files, making an update of the module possible.


## How does it work

The principle of hook is simple. A smarty function or a smarty block is added in the template. When smarty parses this function/block an event is created and dispatched to methods of modules that listen to this hook event.

This event just grab contents generated by the chain of modules. When the event is finished, the content is injected in place of the function/block.

There is two distinct behaviors for managing hooks : 

- the smarty function ```{hook name="hookname" ... }``` which only inject the code generated during the event propagation. *The fragments of HTML code generated in modules are simply concatenated*. These hooks use a ```Thelia\Core\Event\Hook\HookRenderEvent``` event.
- the smarty block ```{hookblock name="hookname" ... }...{/hookblock}``` which works with ```{hookfor rel="hookname" ... }{/hookfor}``` smarty block and allows you to loop on each fragments generated in modules. These hooks use a ```Thelia\Core\Event\Hook\HookRenderBlockEvent``` event.


### Example of a hook function :

In this example, the hook code is ```product.details.top``` and the code generated by modules listening to this hook is concatenated and injected here.

*Notice: you can add arguments to the smarty function (or block) to help identify the context of the request. Here, we have the product id that allows you to perform test on this product and display informations related to the current product.*

```html
...
<section id="product-details">
    {hook name="product.details.top" product="{$ID}"}
...
```


### Example of a hook block :

The smarty block is a little bit more complex but more flexible. This hook provides a list of row, each row has a list of variables. It is used in conjunction with the ```hookfor``` block that allow you to iterate on each row and assign variables to smarty. The variables may be different depending on the hook. You have to refer to the documentation of that hook.


```html
...
<section id="product-tabs">
    {hookBlock name="product.additional" product="{product attr="id"}"}
    <ul class="nav nav-tabs" role="tablist">
        <li class="active" role="presentation"><a id="tab1" href="#description" data-toggle="tab" role="tab">{intl l="Description"}</a></li>
        {forHook rel="product.additional"}
            <li role="presentation"><a id="tab{$id}" href="#{$id}" data-toggle="tab" role="tab">{$title}</a></li>
        {/forHook}
    </ul>
    <div class="tab-content">
        <div class="tab-pane active in" id="description" itemprop="description" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="tab1">
            <p>{$DESCRIPTION|default:'N/A' nofilter}</p>
        </div>
        {forHook rel="product.additional"}
        <div class="tab-pane" id="{$id}" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="tab{$id}">
            {$content nofilter}
        </div>
        {/forHook}
    </div>
    {/hookBlock}
</section>
...
```
